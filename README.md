## HOW did it happen

_I don't really know what am I supossed 2 do that's why I am doing this lol_

**Career???**: I created this GitHub acc because I just started CS in a prestigious college in my country, I did halfway of a HTML course and thought I could live with that. Clearly I can't, but I lack the discipline to actually learn more and not just watch videos abt this :crying_cat_face: 

**What is my goal?**: I'd like to learn how to code a videogame, apps or anything. I just want to create things for people who can enjoy them at their fullest :) 

**Do u hate yourself 4 what you just did?**: If you mean just throwing myself into a career with no knowledge and hoping for the best to happen? a little bit... m(_ _)m

That is pretty much a nice introduction of this acc, and hopefully no classmate will ever find this :D 


### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to your newly made repository. Then, work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
2. Navigate to the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository.

3. Click on the **main** branch drop-down.

   ![main-branch-dropdown](/images/main-branch-dropdown.png)

4. In the field, name your branch `my-first-branch`. In this case, the name must be `my-first-branch` to trigger the course workflow.
5. Click **Create branch: my-first-branch** to create your branch.

   ![create-branch-button](/images/create-branch-button.png)

   The branch will automatically switch to the one you have just created.
   The **main** branch drop-down bar will reflect your new branch and display the new branch name.

6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
